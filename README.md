## Usage

    npx create-react-app newapp

## Specification

The app removes all React logos (leaves React favicon) and .css files, references to them are removed from relevant files (App.js, index.js, manifest.json). Finally, App.js is trimmed down to produce empty homepage. README.md is left empty too.
